AC coupling, also known as capacitor coupling or capacitively coupled coupling, is a technique used in electronic circuits to separate the direct current (DC) component from the alternating current (AC) component of a signal.

In AC coupling, a coupling capacitor is placed in series with the input or output of a circuit. The capacitor acts as a high-pass filter, allowing only the AC component of the signal to pass through while blocking the DC component. The AC component is coupled, or transmitted, to the next stage or circuit, while the DC component is blocked or attenuated.

The purpose of AC coupling is to remove any DC offset or bias present in a signal, enabling the circuit to operate more effectively with AC signals. It is commonly used in applications such as audio amplifiers, where it is necessary to remove any DC voltage present in the input signal before amplification. AC coupling allows for the amplification and processing of the AC signal without distortion or saturation.

It is important to choose an appropriate value for the ***coupling capacitor, considering the desired frequency response*** and the impedance of the connected stages. The capacitor value is selected such that it allows the desired AC frequencies to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies, including the DC component. The choice of capacitor value influences the cutoff frequency and the overall frequency response of the circuit.

AC coupling through a capacitor is a widely used technique in electronic circuits, providing a means to isolate the AC and DC components of a signal and enable effective signal processing and amplification.
